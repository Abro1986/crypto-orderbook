The Crypto-Orderbook is a Node.JS application using express. If an application offers an HTTP request with two coins to compare in a market to this API end point https://secret-spire-98789.herokuapp.com/api/orderbook then the Crypto-Orderbook will serve up the combined orderbooks of Bittrex and Poloniex trading. it will serve the volume of the coin to be bought or sold for the price it must be exchanged at. I have also made a little React application published at http://bent-writer.surge.sh/ that can offer up just two markets at this point(Bitcoin to Ethereum, and Bitcoin to Litecoin). These order books show market depth, and at this point can do nothing more than show where the market could be going at just that moment. Toggling back and forth between the two markets will almost always serve up new data because the market is constantly changing.
